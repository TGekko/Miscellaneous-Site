   <h2>The Beginning</h2>
   The party receives a letter from, supposedly, Kolyan Indirovich. Later they discover that it was written by Strahd:<br>
   <img style="width: 100%; height: 10em;" src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/831/cos19-10.png"/><br>
   <img class='float-right' style="width: 15em;" src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/8/228/f1.jpg"/>
   "Hail to thee of might and valor.<br>
   <br>
   I, a lowly servant of Barovia, send honor to thee. We plead for thy so desperately needed assistance.<br>
   <br>
   The love of my life, Ireena Kolyana, has been afflicted by an evil so deadly that even the good people of our village cannot protect her. She languishes from her wound, and I would have her saved from this menace.<br>
   <br>
   There is much wealth in this community. I offer all that might be had to thee and thy fellows if thou shalt but answer my desperate plea.<br>
   <br>
   Come quickly, for her time is at hand! All that I have shall be thine!<br>
   <br>
   Kolyan Indirovich<br>
   Burgomaster"<br>
   <h2>Barovia</h2>
   The party approaches the gates of Barovia:<br>
   <img src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/714/cos02-04.png"/><br><br>
   <span class='hidden' id='Heading-Map'></span>
   This map is acquired in the Village of Barovia, noted below:<br>
   <img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/765/cos201.jpg"/><br><br>
   As the party travels along the road, they find the body of a man clutching the following letter:<br><br>
   <img class='float-right' style='width: 15em;' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/8/234/f7.jpg"/>
   "Hail thee of might and valor:<br>
   <br>
   I, the Burgomaster of Barovia, send you honor—with despair.<br>
   <br>
   My adopted daughter, the fair Ireena Kolyana, has been these past nights bitten by a vampyr. For over four hundred years, this creature has drained the life blood of my people. Now, my dear Ireena languishes and dies from an unholy wound caused by this vile beast. He has become too powerful to conquer.<br>
   <br>
   So I say to you, give us up for dead and encircle this land with the symbols of good. Let holy men call upon their power that the devil may be contained within the walls of weeping Barovia. Leave our sorrows to our graves, and save the world from this evil fate of ours.<br>
   <br>
   There is much wealth entrapped in this community. Return for your reward after we are all departed for a better life.<br>
   <br>
   Kolyan Indirovich<br>
   Burgomaster"<br>
   <h2>Barovia Village</h2>
   <img class='float-left' style='width: 30%;' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/2/767/cos301.jpg"/>
   Along the road to a nearby village, the party meets two people, one of which, Flippelbottom Tillywix, joins them. <a title='Quinn' class="Quinn em-img" href='#Quinn'></a> Po, Quinn before he regained his memories, tries to pick the pocket of the other -- who intercepts the attempt and laughs before walking away.<br><br>
   The party enters the village of Barovia, chased by a destructive fog which tears at those who enter it.<br><br>
   The deadly fog ushers the party into a building known as the "Death House".<br><br>
   <img class='float-right' style='width: 30%;' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/3/238/deathhouseplayer.jpg"/>
   The fog closes in around the building and fills it as the party explores the house -- a house haunted by the ghosts of those who died or were slaughtered there.<br><br>
   As the party climbs the house, they come across a letter from Strahd to someone long dead:<br><br>
   "My most pathetic servant,<br>
   <br>
   I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.<br>
   <br>
   You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.<br>
   <br>
   Your dread lord and master,<br>
   <br>
   Strahd von Zarovich"<br><br>
   The party also finds the ghosts of two children. The ghost of a young boy posesses <a title='Therin' class="Therin em-img" href='#Therin'></a> Therin temporarily, altering his personality.<br><br>
   The party discovers a hidden staircase which leads to an underground dungeon. <a title='Kael' class="Kael em-img" href='#Kael'></a> Kael manages to trigger every trap and ambush within, while <a title='Therin' class="Therin em-img" href='#Therin'></a> Therin enjoys finding some gold and minor treasures.<br><br>
   Descending farther, they find a room leading to a flooded altar. The room contains some alcoves filled with cult-ish objects, and the altar rests behind an iron gate.<br><br>
   The party finds a way to the altar and, as they enter, they are met with the ghosts of cultists. These cultists demand a sacrifice. Initially, the party refuses to kill anybody. The cultists, displeased, summon a Shambling Mound which pursues the party as they follow <a title='Gregor' class="Gregor em-img" href='#Gregor'></a> Gregor throughout the house. They would have run, but <a title='Gregor' class="Gregor em-img" href='#Gregor'></a> Gregor blocked everybody's path the whole way through.<br><br>
   Believing the house to still be filled with fog, the party felt trapped. Eventually, while evading the Shambling Mound, <a title='Sylvenna' class="Sylvenna em-img" href='#Sylvenna'></a> Sylvenna takes Flippelbottom back down to the alter, calls him a hero, then mercilessly runs him through. This appeases the cultists, and <a title='Therin' class="Therin em-img" href='#Therin'></a> Therin takes Flippelbottom's clothing -- somehow wearing it well even though Flippelbottom was half of <a title='Therin' class="Therin em-img" href='#Therin'></a> Therin's height.<br><br>
   With the cultists' ghosts satisfied with Flippelbottom dead and the Shambling Mound gone, the party takes Flippelbottom's body with them as they leave the house. Finding a nearby tavern to rest in, they unceremoniously plop Flippelbottom's body in a nearby cart -- likely owned by people called the Vistani. In the tavern, <a title='Sylvenna' class="Sylvenna em-img" href='#Sylvenna'></a> Sylvenna speaks with some Vistani. They give her a map of Barovia and tell her to visit a woman named Madam Eva at the Tser Pools Encampment. They slept haphazardly in the tavern.<br><br>
   In the morning, the cart in which they stowed Flippelbottom is gone. They ignore this and move on to the house of the Burgomaster, who supposedly sent them the letter that brought them here, at the request of his son, <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/719/cos03-03.png"/> Ismark, who was in the tavern. The party shows <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/719/cos03-03.png"/> Ismark the letter they received from his father. <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/719/cos03-03.png"/> Ismark confirms that this could not have been written by his father, who was recently deceased, as the handwriting and signature did not match that of his father.<br><br>
   <img class='float-right' style="width: 10em;" src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/721/cos03-05.png"/>
   There, they find <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/721/cos03-05.png"/> Ireena Kolyana, sister to Ismark. Strahd is interested in <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/721/cos03-05.png"/> Ireena, so they request the help of the party in escorting her to Vallaki. During this request, <a title='Cedric' class="Cedric em-img" href='#Cedric'></a> Cedric expresses that they saw a kid be kidnapped and didn't do anything about it. Thankfully, he expressed this in such a strange way that <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/721/cos03-05.png"/> Ireena and <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/719/cos03-03.png"/> Ismark dismiss the comment.<br><br>
   <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/721/cos03-05.png"/> Ireena joins the party, and also asks for help transporting a coffin, containing the recently deceased Burgomaster, to the cemetery. During this interaction, the party realizes that they left <a title='Kael' class="Kael em-img" href='#Kael'></a> Kael sleeping under a table in the tavern for the whole day.<br><br>
   <img class='float-left' style='width: 17em' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/2/768/cos302.jpg"/>
   Upon visiting the church, the party heckles <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/723/cos03-07.png"/> a terrified priest, breaks into the basement, and beheads <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/724/cos03-08.png"/> a vampire spawn. The vampire spawn was the son of the <img class='em-img' src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/1/723/cos03-07.png"/> priest, whom he kept down there since a failed raid of Castle Ravenloft.<br><br>
   They bury the Burgomaster behind the church, and they stay there for the night. The church is accosted by Strahd Zombies in the dark, but the party leaves safely the next day.<br>
   <span class='hidden' id='Heading-Main-Quest'></span>
   <h2>Tser Pool Encampment</h2>
   Here, the party approaches a camp of Vistani. In a large tent, they find Madam Eva, who reads their fortunes with a deck of cards:<br><br>
   To <a title='Sylvenna' class="Sylvenna em-img" href='#Sylvenna'></a> Sylvenna, she says, "This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight. I see a lonely mill on a precipice. The treasure lies within."<br>
   <span class='indent'>Status: </span><span class='green'>Success - The Sunsword was acquired.</span><br>
   To <a title='Therin' class='Therin em-img' href='#Therin'></a> Therin, she says, "This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope. There is a town where all is not well. There you will find a house of corruption, and within, a dark room full of still ghosts."<br>
   <span class='indent'>Status: </span><span class='green'>Success - The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind was acquired.</span><br>
   To <a title='Gregor' class='Gregor em-img' href='#Gregor'></a> Gregor, she says, "This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness. Search for a troubled young man surrounded by wealth and madness. His home is his prison."<br>
   <span class='indent'>Status: </span><span class='red'>Failure - Victor Vallakovich died needlessly in a den of vampire spawn.</span><br>
   To <a title='Quinn' class='Quinn em-img' href='#Quinn'></a> Po, she says, "This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy. Look to the west. Find a pool blessed by the light of the white sun."<br>
   <span class='indent'>Status: </span><span class='yellow'>In Progress - Go to Kresk.</span><br>
   To <a title='Kael' class='Kael em-img' href='#Kael'></a> Kael, she says, "Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him! He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all."<br>
   <span class='indent'>Status: </span><span class='yellow'>In Progress - Strahd's exact location?</span><br><br>
   After this, the Vistani offer what materials they have in their carts to the party. Most of the carts had nothing, but <a title='Quinn' class="Quinn em-img" href='#Quinn'></a> Po finds plenty of gold in the cart he checked.<br>
   <h2>The Old Bonegrinder & The Megaliths</h2>
   <img class='float-right' style="width: 10em;" src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/attachments/2/775/cos601.jpg"/>
   The party, on their way to Vallaki, find an old windmill. Upon entering, they find a seemingly nice old lady baking meat pies. They also breifly spy her two unsightly daughters. Discovering that the meat pies are actually Dream Pastries which induce a trance, and finding evidence of disturbing activity within the windmill, the party speaks carefully with the old woman.<br><br>
   <img class='float-right' style="width: 6em;" src="https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/thumbnails/5738/105/1000/1000/636898360872962338.jpeg"/>
   They discover that this witch-like woman is in posession of the fabled Sunsword -- bane of Strahd. <a title='Kael' class="Kael em-img" href='#Kael'></a> Kael remembers the importance of this weapon, remembering one of the fortunes from Madam Eva. Somehow, through some miracle, the party charms the woman and simply asks for the sword. She hands it to them, realizing what happened shortly after. This enrages her, and she reveals that she is actually a Night Hag.<br><br>
   The party immediately flees, afraid of the Night Hags within the Old Bonegrinder. Impossibly, they escape with the Sunsword entirely unharmed.<br><br>
   As they flee, they come to a set of four megaliths. Different members of the party approach each megalith, receiving visions of faraway cities depicting the four seasons:<br><br>
   The Monument of Spring, representing the mountain city of Druvenlahr, is a tall, moss-covered pillar of veined granite. At its center: a harp carved atop a flowering mountain. The vines growing on the stone blossom unnaturally in its presence. Carved in Druidic & Old Dwarvish is the inscription: “She sang to the earth, and it bloomed. But nothing green grows forever.” The party member experiences the following vision: The stone hums softly beneath your feet, like the echo of a distant song. You see glimpses of a mountaintop city, dwarves and druids coaxing life from stone -- orchards carved into cliff sides, mountain goats frolicking where snow once clung. Laughter. Celebration. Then… cracks. The land splits. Screams echo through the rock. Spring fed them. But spring turned to greed. And the mountain claimed what it had given.<br><br>
   The monument of Summer, representing the gleaming, innovative city of Auron’Thal, is a scorched obsidian slab. The sunburst-and-anvil motif is deeply carved, but heat cracks run across the surface. The stone is warm to the touch, even in the cold air. Inscribed in the stone is can be seen, “He forged the sun, but even suns burn out.” The party member experiences the following vision: You see forges blazing with light, brighter than fire should burn -- radiant machines, flying constructs, beacons of holy flame. A city gleaming with pride, with purpose. But pride draws envy. And envy… invites darkness. One day, the fires stutter. Then one by one, they die. What was once brilliance becomes ruin -- blackened, forgotten, cold.<br><br>
   The monument of Autumn, representing the tranquil, ancient elven city of Velkynmere, is a smooth pillar of red-gold marble, covered in carved leaves -- many of which are cracked or faded. In the center is carved a single eye beneath drifting leaves. An inscription on the stone says, “She saw too far, and the leaves never stopped falling.” The party member experiences the following vision: The wind turns colder as you draw near. In your mind’s eye, you see an ancient elven city beneath the boughs -- tranquil, eternal, thoughtful. Seers and prophets gather beneath the trees, visions flickering in their minds. One sees the end. She cries out -- too late. Autumn comes. The leaves fall. No one hears her warning.<br><br>
   The monument of Winter, representing the lost, now silent city of Sai'el, is the coldest of the four. It is covered in pale frost that doesn’t melt, even under torchlight. A crescent moon is depicted in chains and floating above snowdrifts or wispy fog. The inscription in the stone reads, “They dreamed of freedom in frozen sleep. But the dream turned on them.” <a title='Quinn' class="Quinn em-img" href='#Quinn'></a> Po experiences the following vision: Cold grips your bones. You see towers of shimmering ice, rituals cast in silence, dreamers sleeping in runes of silver. Their dreams were meant to preserve them -- to escape what the mists could not reach. But something… else reached them first. One night, they all awoke. Screaming. And the screams did not stop. <a title='Quinn' class="Quinn em-img" href='#Quinn'></a> Po feels something watching him. A memory. The name of his childhood friend, Lyn, nearly spoken in his mind.<br><br>
   "The wind shifts. The stones fall silent. Four cities. Four falls. Four lessons carved into a land that forgets nothing. And yet you stand -- new blood in cursed soil. Will your names be carved in stone one day? Or merely whispered… like the rest?"<br><br>
